## Goal
This repo is aiming to show how to build the very basic and simple frontend service and works by connecting to [elasticsearch_express](https://github.com/melancholy14/elasticsearch_express)

## Features & To do
- [x] User can log in
- [x] User can take questions
- [x] User can review the answer is correct after it's submitted
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] User can sign up
- [ ] User can see all questions and answers that s/he resolved
- [ ] Admin can add/edit/delete a question

## Tech Stack
1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-templated.
2. [Material-UI](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/): This ui library is one of the most famous ones, developed and maintained by Google. I haven't used this before so I decided to make a new experience with it.
3. [React-Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview): This out-of-box data-fetching library helps developers not only communicating with the backend but also caching, synchronizing and updating server state

## My Choices
- No Routing
1. The user flow of this app is quite simple, "log in -> take a quiz -> finish -> log out", and one page would be enough to display all steps using `useState`.
2. Personally, I wanted to avoid additional minor tasks since having routing would give me another task such as authenticating when users access through a different path, not login.
- No Redux: This simple app does not require saving much data in a single source of storage, which means it's enough to use the cookie. [`Redux`](https://react-redux.js.org/) would be added once the app's scale becomes enlarged.

## Structure

### User Case
This application would be responsible for the client part in the below case:
